SUPER BROWSER README

Hey - No one will probably read this but I just wanted to put in some information about my project

A few things:
1. This is my first project - give me a break about crappy programing

2. I don't know if other people have already discovered this but I found the way to put the title in the caption part of the form. Also the url goes into the url text box - even if you click from a link

3. This is also the version of this code and within a few minutes of putting this on the site I will be working on it more. I look to put on:
	-Bookmarks/Favourites
	-E-Mail
	-Better Source editor
	-A tutorial to make your own browser

4. I started commenting the code to help people - but got bored of it. In future versions I will comment more

5. The more the votes the more things I will put into future versions

See Ya
